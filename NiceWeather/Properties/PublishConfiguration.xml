	<LongDescription>
Disables the rain, snow, clouds, and fog in the game and in the editor for better visibility.

The mod makes it easier to work with the image overlay in city building projects, as the snow, clouds, and fog obstruct the view of the road, tram, and train networks.

The settings on the "Options" page control which elements should be disabled in the game and in the editor.

- The "Disable Rain" toggle stops the rain and prevents further rainfall.
- The "Disable Snow" toggle stops the snow, removes the existing snow to reveal the roads and tracks on the ground, and prevents further snowfall.
- The "Disable Clouds" and "Disable Fog" toggles disable and remove the clouds and fog.
