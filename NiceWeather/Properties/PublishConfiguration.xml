### What it does
Stops the rain, and snow, removes snow, clouds, and fog in the game and in the editor for better visibility.

The mod makes it easier to build your city, and to work with the image overlay in city building projects, as the snow, clouds, and fog obstruct the view of the road, tram, and train networks, and makes it very hard to see the overlay image.

The settings on the "Options" page control which elements should be removed in the game and in the editor.

- The "No Rain" toggle stops the rain and prevents further rainfall.
- The "No Snow" toggle stops the snow, removes the existing snow to reveal the roads and tracks on the ground, and prevents further snowfall.
- The "No Clouds" and "No Fog" toggles disable and remove the clouds and fog.

### Safe
This mod does not modify your savegames, and should be safe to remove it at any time.

### How it works
The mod periodically checks the weather and if a disabled weather element is detected, it stops and removes it.
To put as less load on the game as possible, it can take a few seconds to detect and remove unwanted elements.
